# arma-2-Object_Separator

ArmA 2 tool to separate normal and special objects in visitor 3 import/export file.

What we mean by normal objects is the ones that do not need special alignment to fit into terrain. Its easier to designate that special objects are bridges and some harbor / pier objects, or like in VTE some gook huts which rest on top of legs in some swamps.

When your terrain project in Visitor 3 only has normal objects in it, you can do align all objects to ground to fix any floating, however if you have any special objects there... you need to manually edit their alignment and obviously after this hard work you do not want to use mass align to ground feature to broke your edits. Here is where object separator comes handy.

Just separate your Visitor 3 objects export list, export only normal objects and align them to ground, then export the remaining special objects.
